# MSE docker image with pytorch

Example of docker image extending [mse-base](https://github.com/Cosmian/mse-docker-base) to add [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/), [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) and tools for machine learning in [MSE](https://cosmian.com/microservice-encryption/).
